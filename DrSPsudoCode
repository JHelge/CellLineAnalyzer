Pseudocode:
	for cell line in matrix:
	    - Remove cell line from trainable data
        for drug in remaining matrix (1 column):
            - Get best performing ML Algo (this includes feature/gene list combo, hyperparams, and actual algorithm).
            - Train best model with best hyperparams.
            - Save model.
        - Predict for hold out cell line with all models.
        - Match best scoring drugs to ACTUAL VALUES.
        - Record overall predictive score.


Sample input folder:
    CellLine X Drug matrix.
    All "X-data" - Master matrix of all cell lines and USED features (used == mentioned in a gene list). (created at runtime)
    DrugFolderForCLA (Gemcitabine) (lots of these == training data == X values):
        inputs:
        - results.csv
        - arguments.csv
        - mut.csv //Feature files
        - gex.csv
        - cnum.csv
        - gene_list1.csv //gene lists
        - gene_list2.csv
        outputs:
        - RandomForestAnalysis.csv
        - LinearSVMAnalysis.csv...etc.
        - FullResultsSummary.txt
        - SummaryReport.html
        - Diagnostics.txt
    
    output:
        - FinalResults.csv == recommended drugs and recommendation score for each cell line.
            - This include diagnostics
                - Diagnostics == "model used: RandomForest, with 20 trees, and 15 nodes, and gene list feature file combo   
                                  gene_list1/gex"
